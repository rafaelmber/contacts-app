# contacts-app

This is a Contacts Web App, where a user can see their contact, edit that information, and add more contacts. Multiple users can store their contacts in this app. So they must have access to their contacts only and hide others user's contacts.

The Contacts App is composed by a web server and a frontend App. The Backend app will serve frontend content, an API, a datebase to store contacts, and user autentication.
